# IDE User Simulation

This is the repository for the Data Processor and User Simulation applications.

To build and test all projects, run:

```
dotnet build
```
and
```
dotnet test
```

## Data Processor

This component loads the log files from the VS Code extension and calculates the transition probabilities of a Markov chain. The parameters for the Markov chain are exported as a JSON file, by default `chain.json`.

### Usage

To use the Data Processor, run:

```
dotnet run --project ./src/dataProcessor/dataProcessor.csproj <path-to-telemetry-file>
```

## User Simulation

This application builds a Markov chain based on the parameters calculated by the Data Processor. Together with an open-source project, it can simulate the creation of a commit. To do this, it searches for a suitable commit and loads the diff between the parent commit and the commit that is to be reproduced. This diff is then applied based on events produced by the Markov chain.

### Usage

To run the simulation, use the following command:

```
dotnet run --project ./src/sim/sim.csproj <operation> [args]
```

### Operation: sim

This mode simulates a user based on a commit from an existing project. For this mode to work, a WorkDir has to be initialized on the WorkDir service with the repository you wish to run the tests with. The id and path of the WorkDir need to be set in the code. In the future, this would ideally be handled through a config file.

```
dotnet run --project ./src/sim/sim.csproj sim <add-ratio> <min-commit-size> <max-commit-size>
```
Example:
```
dotnet run --project ./src/sim/sim.csproj sim 0.75 50 100
```

- **add-ratio**: An additional parameter for the Markov chain which controls the ratio between insertions and deletions.
- **min-commit-size**: Search for commits with at least this many lines added.
- **max-commit-size**: Search for commits with at most this many lines added.

### Operation: replay

This mode replays events recorded in a telemetry file. For this, you also need to set up the repository as described for sim mode. Make sure it is the same repository as the one used to collect the telemetry data.

```
dotnet run --project ./src/sim/sim.csproj replay <path-to-telemetry-file>
```
